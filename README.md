# Rummy Score Tracker App

I created this app in order to stop having to keep score of the game on paper. It has all the capabilities you would have when keeping track of score on paper, and more! You can keep track of everyone's scores, view game history, easily calculate the winner, and easily reset the game with just a click of a button. The exact variation of Rummy is "Liverpool," which is the variation I would always play at my grandparents with my family. You can view the live build of this project [here](https://rummy-score-app.vercel.app/)
